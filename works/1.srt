00:00:06,320 --> 00:00:08,560
NETFLIX PRESENTS

2
00:01:35,800 --> 00:01:39,160
<i>There are three types of person:</i>

3
00:01:39,840 --> 00:01:42,040
<i>Those at the top,</i>

4
00:01:42,120 --> 00:01:43,640
<i>those at the bottom,</i>

5
00:01:44,320 --> 00:01:45,520
<i>and those who fall.</i>

6
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:28,160
Level 48.

7
00:02:35,320 --> 00:02:37,440
- The hole.
- Yes.

8
00:02:38,200 --> 00:02:39,320
The hole.

9
00:02:41,200 --> 00:02:43,000
And it's the start of the month.

10
00:02:44,120 --> 00:02:46,280
So the question is:

11
00:02:46,360 --> 00:02:47,800
What are we going to eat?

12
00:02:49,200 --> 00:02:50,880
What are we going to eat?

13
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:54,800
Obvious. The people above's left-overs.

14
00:02:56,880 --> 00:03:02,160
- Who are the people up above?
- The people on Level 47. Obviously.

15
00:04:00,800 --> 00:04:02,360
My name's Goreng.

16
00:04:08,440 --> 00:04:11,120
Please stay on your side of the hole.

17
00:04:13,160 --> 00:04:14,280
Goreng.

18
00:04:25,640 --> 00:04:27,480
What name have they given you?

19
00:04:28,240 --> 00:04:29,240
Yes.

20
00:04:29,680 --> 00:04:32,320
We should know each other's names.

21
00:04:32,400 --> 00:04:34,520
We'll be together for a long time.

22
00:04:36,120 --> 00:04:37,320
Or maybe not.

23
00:04:38,200 --> 00:04:39,680
Who knows?

24
00:04:44,200 --> 00:04:46,200
My name is Trimagasi.

25
00:04:49,760 --> 00:04:54,200
Mr. Trimagasi, do you know
what the hole entails?

26
00:04:54,280 --> 00:04:56,880
It's obvious: eating.

27
00:04:58,320 --> 00:05:00,080
At times, it's easy,

28
00:05:00,160 --> 00:05:01,960
others, difficult...

29
00:05:02,040 --> 00:05:03,960
It depends where you're assigned.

30
00:05:04,040 --> 00:05:07,200
Fortunately, No. 48 is a good level.

31
00:05:10,520 --> 00:05:13,680
Are there many more people below?
Don't tell me...

32
00:05:14,720 --> 00:05:16,080
It's obvious.

33
00:05:17,960 --> 00:05:20,160
Soon, there will be fewer of them.

34
00:05:24,280 --> 00:05:27,440
- You, down there! Can you hear me?
- Don't speak to the people below.

35
00:05:28,440 --> 00:05:30,440
- Why?
- Because they're down below.

36
00:05:31,920 --> 00:05:33,800
The people above won't answer you.

37
00:05:33,880 --> 00:05:36,960
- Why?
- Because they're above, obviously.

38
00:05:37,040 --> 00:05:40,720
You think it's all very obvious.
You must have been here a long time.

39
00:05:40,800 --> 00:05:44,880
Months. Many, many months.

40
00:05:44,960 --> 00:05:48,640
And I repeat, 48 is a good level,

41
00:05:48,720 --> 00:05:51,160
and you've been very lucky.

42
00:05:51,240 --> 00:05:53,760
And how long are we going to spend
on this wonderful level?

43
00:05:53,840 --> 00:05:56,160
We'll be here for exactly a month.

44
00:05:56,760 --> 00:05:58,720
Then, we will see.

45
00:05:58,800 --> 00:06:01,440
That's the last question I'll answer.

46
00:06:01,520 --> 00:06:03,280
Speaking tires me out.

47
00:06:04,200 --> 00:06:07,440
Especially when I have to give
more information than I get.

48
00:06:08,800 --> 00:06:10,080
That's not fair, obviously.

49
00:06:10,160 --> 00:06:12,080
From now on,

50
00:06:12,160 --> 00:06:15,480
I will give you as much information
as you give me.

51
00:06:29,240 --> 00:06:31,320
The red light went off
and the green one came on.

52
00:06:32,440 --> 00:06:34,080
I've just given you information.

53
00:06:34,160 --> 00:06:37,160
Now, it's only fair for you
to give me some, right?

54
00:06:38,400 --> 00:06:40,880
Why did the red light go off
and the green one come on?

55
00:07:09,160 --> 00:07:11,120
This food has already been eaten.

56
00:07:11,560 --> 00:07:14,560
That's so obvious,
I won't even say "obviously."

57
00:07:14,640 --> 00:07:16,360
It's disgusting.

58
00:07:22,320 --> 00:07:23,680
Let's see.

59
00:07:24,400 --> 00:07:27,120
If there are 47 levels above us
and two people per level,

60
00:07:27,200 --> 00:07:29,440
are we eating 94 people's left-overs?

61
00:07:30,160 --> 00:07:31,160
Don't worry.

62
00:07:31,240 --> 00:07:33,520
As the month goes by,
there'll be fewer people up above.

63
00:07:33,960 --> 00:07:36,280
- Aren't you going to eat?
- I'm not hungry.

64
00:07:37,120 --> 00:07:38,720
You will be.

65
00:07:43,600 --> 00:07:45,880
Why did you say there'd be
fewer people next month?

66
00:07:45,960 --> 00:07:48,880
I won't say it's obvious,
because it's not.

67
00:07:48,960 --> 00:07:51,800
I didn't understand myself
till I was on Level 8.

68
00:07:52,320 --> 00:07:53,520
Wine!

69
00:07:54,080 --> 00:07:58,640
There must be quite a few Muslims
and teetotalers up there.

70
00:08:00,440 --> 00:08:02,840
Normally, the drink's all gone by now.

71
00:08:03,600 --> 00:08:05,440
Are you really not going to eat?

72
00:08:18,960 --> 00:08:19,960
For later.

73
00:08:35,960 --> 00:08:37,040
Why did you do that?

74
00:08:37,840 --> 00:08:39,520
For the people down there to eat.

75
00:08:39,600 --> 00:08:41,360
What if the people above did the same?

76
00:08:42,120 --> 00:08:43,760
They probably do.

77
00:08:45,840 --> 00:08:47,160
Bastards.

78
00:08:50,120 --> 00:08:52,600
- Isn't it very hot in here?
- And it'll get even hotter.

79
00:08:52,680 --> 00:08:54,200
Hotter?

80
00:08:54,280 --> 00:08:56,640
We'll be burned to a cinder.

81
00:08:57,280 --> 00:08:58,440
Really? Why?

82
00:08:58,520 --> 00:09:00,120
It's your fault.

83
00:09:00,200 --> 00:09:03,760
The temperature will keep rising
unchecked unless...

84
00:09:06,600 --> 00:09:09,720
- Unless what?
- Unless you get rid of that apple.

85
00:09:09,800 --> 00:09:13,680
The food only belongs to us
while the platform is on our level.

86
00:09:13,760 --> 00:09:18,280
If you keep anything,
the temperature rises till we're cooked.

87
00:09:18,360 --> 00:09:20,400
Or falls till we freeze.

88
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:22,000
It depends.

89
00:09:24,480 --> 00:09:25,760
Shit.

90
00:09:33,360 --> 00:09:34,880
Do you understand?

91
00:09:37,720 --> 00:09:39,560
I said, do you understand?

92
00:09:39,960 --> 00:09:40,960
What?

93
00:09:42,440 --> 00:09:46,600
Once you're inside, you can't get out
till the agreed period is over.

94
00:09:48,360 --> 00:09:49,800
So, I've been accepted?

95
00:09:50,520 --> 00:09:51,640
Not yet.

96
00:09:59,920 --> 00:10:01,480
Can my item be a book?

97
00:10:02,480 --> 00:10:04,120
It can be whatever you want.

98
00:10:08,880 --> 00:10:10,680
THE INGENIOUS GENTLEMAN
DON QUIXOTE

99
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:21,920
I'd like to tell you why I'm here.

100
00:10:22,920 --> 00:10:24,000
What for?

101
00:10:24,560 --> 00:10:27,080
So that then you'll tell me
why you're here.

102
00:10:27,160 --> 00:10:28,160
It's obvious.

103
00:10:30,800 --> 00:10:33,160
I wanted to quit smoking
and read <i>Don Quixote.</i>

104
00:10:33,960 --> 00:10:37,080
They said I could bring an item.
So, I thought I've never...

105
00:10:37,160 --> 00:10:38,800
You came here voluntarily?

106
00:10:42,800 --> 00:10:45,520
Six months in exchange
for an accredited diploma.

107
00:10:46,400 --> 00:10:48,040
An accredited diploma?

108
00:10:49,720 --> 00:10:51,600
An accredited diploma?

109
00:10:53,760 --> 00:10:56,040
I should get two.

110
00:10:56,120 --> 00:10:58,480
I came for a year.

111
00:10:58,560 --> 00:10:59,840
Why are you here?

112
00:11:11,920 --> 00:11:14,440
They give this guy one, and not me.

113
00:11:35,480 --> 00:11:37,360
I'd stand back if I were you.

114
00:12:01,440 --> 00:12:04,360
- Aren't you going to eat today either?
- Obviously not.

115
00:12:05,080 --> 00:12:06,200
What a waste!

116
00:12:06,920 --> 00:12:08,680
You don't deserve to be on this level.

117
00:12:11,040 --> 00:12:12,760
You haven't told me why you're here.

118
00:12:20,680 --> 00:12:22,120
Come on. Tell me.

119
00:12:26,040 --> 00:12:31,400
Only if you promise
not to borrow the word "obviously" again.

120
00:12:37,520 --> 00:12:42,560
I was at home, and an ad came on TV.
A bearded chap with a knife-sharpener.

121
00:12:42,640 --> 00:12:48,080
"The Samurai-Max sharpens any blade,
straight or serrated," he said.

122
00:12:49,080 --> 00:12:50,720
"Look at this knife.

123
00:12:50,800 --> 00:12:54,320
It's so blunt, it wouldn't cut a sponge.

124
00:12:54,400 --> 00:12:56,480
But just apply the Samurai-Max,

125
00:12:56,560 --> 00:13:00,000
and you can cut even the hardest surfaces,
like this brick.

126
00:13:00,080 --> 00:13:03,560
And it was true. He cut it.

127
00:13:09,600 --> 00:13:12,880
Then, a few housewives came on,

128
00:13:12,960 --> 00:13:16,960
saying how the Samurai-Max
had changed their lives.

129
00:13:18,080 --> 00:13:20,600
"We could never cut tomatoes,

130
00:13:20,680 --> 00:13:23,320
bread fell to pieces when we cut it.

131
00:13:24,400 --> 00:13:27,680
The Samurai-Max changed our lives,"
they all said.

132
00:13:28,320 --> 00:13:30,960
Honestly, I've never peeled a tomato,

133
00:13:31,040 --> 00:13:33,120
and I always buy sliced bread.

134
00:13:33,200 --> 00:13:38,080
And I've never known why you'd want
to cut a brick with a kitchen knife.

135
00:13:39,680 --> 00:13:41,120
But I started to think...

136
00:13:41,840 --> 00:13:44,160
Why don't I sharpen my knives?

137
00:13:44,240 --> 00:13:47,440
Maybe my life is such crap
because I don't sharpen my knives,

138
00:13:47,520 --> 00:13:49,160
don't look after the little things.

139
00:13:49,560 --> 00:13:52,520
- The little things, Goreng.
- Did you buy it?

140
00:13:53,600 --> 00:13:56,360
- Obviously.
- And what did you do?

141
00:13:56,440 --> 00:13:59,760
Sharpen your knives and slice open
someone's throat, or what?

142
00:14:03,680 --> 00:14:07,240
After I bought it,
I watched the next advertisement.

143
00:14:07,320 --> 00:14:10,160
The same guy with the beard
came on with the same housewives.

144
00:14:11,320 --> 00:14:13,240
Know what they were advertising?

145
00:14:13,960 --> 00:14:18,920
A knife that didn't go blunt
even if you cut a brick with it.

146
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:23,320
The knife sharpened itself, as it cut.

147
00:14:24,560 --> 00:14:26,360
Know what the knife was called?

148
00:14:27,080 --> 00:14:29,840
- The Samurai-Plus.
- You bought it too?

149
00:14:30,240 --> 00:14:33,200
- No, no...
- Obviously, they were taking the piss.

150
00:14:33,720 --> 00:14:35,200
The little things...

151
00:14:36,400 --> 00:14:39,080
Because of the little things,
I couldn't take it anymore.

152
00:14:40,920 --> 00:14:42,960
I took my television set...

153
00:14:43,040 --> 00:14:44,640
and threw it out the window.

154
00:14:44,720 --> 00:14:48,840
It fell on some bloody illegal immigrant
on his bicycle.

155
00:14:48,920 --> 00:14:51,320
Tell me, was that guy's death my fault?

156
00:14:52,120 --> 00:14:54,080
He shouldn't even have been there.

157
00:14:58,880 --> 00:15:01,680
You killed a man, and they took you here?

158
00:15:01,760 --> 00:15:05,160
They gave me a choice between
a psychiatric hospital and the hole.

159
00:15:05,840 --> 00:15:07,040
And I came here.

160
00:15:07,960 --> 00:15:11,000
They never offered me
an accredited diploma, though.

161
00:15:16,040 --> 00:15:17,360
How many levels are there?

162
00:15:17,440 --> 00:15:21,960
I don't know. But I know there are
more than 132, because I was there.

163
00:15:22,040 --> 00:15:23,520
One hundred and thirty two?

164
00:15:23,600 --> 00:15:25,360
And there were more below.

165
00:15:26,240 --> 00:15:28,640
- How much food gets to that level?
- None.

166
00:15:28,720 --> 00:15:31,080
You can't go without food for 30 days.

167
00:15:31,160 --> 00:15:32,760
I didn't say I didn't eat anything,

168
00:15:32,840 --> 00:15:34,720
just that no food got down there.

169
00:15:34,800 --> 00:15:37,120
And you can go without food
for more than 30 days.

170
00:15:37,200 --> 00:15:40,520
The problem is when you get assigned
to two lower levels consecutively.

171
00:15:42,720 --> 00:15:44,480
We need to tell the people up there.

172
00:15:44,560 --> 00:15:46,440
- What for?
- What do you mean?

173
00:15:46,520 --> 00:15:50,080
We can tell them to ration the food
and pass the message up to Level 46,

174
00:15:50,160 --> 00:15:52,120
and from there to Level 45...

175
00:15:53,640 --> 00:15:55,120
Are you a communist?

176
00:15:55,920 --> 00:15:58,160
It's fairer to ration out the food.

177
00:15:58,800 --> 00:16:00,920
Up there, they won't heed a communist.

178
00:16:01,360 --> 00:16:03,240
Then I'll start with down below.

179
00:16:03,320 --> 00:16:05,560
Hey! You in 49, can you hear me?

180
00:16:08,800 --> 00:16:11,600
Leave more wine next time, bastards!

181
00:16:11,680 --> 00:16:14,240
There's your wine, fuckers!

182
00:16:17,840 --> 00:16:20,880
The people below us are below us.

183
00:16:20,960 --> 00:16:24,200
- Next month they might be above us.
- Yes, and they'll piss on us.

184
00:16:26,040 --> 00:16:27,680
The bastards.

185
00:16:38,320 --> 00:16:39,920
I chose a book.

186
00:16:41,320 --> 00:16:42,960
What did you choose?

187
00:16:44,120 --> 00:16:45,320
It's obvious.

188
00:16:49,200 --> 00:16:50,960
The Samurai-Plus.

189
00:17:50,120 --> 00:17:51,840
Do you never get tired of doing that?

190
00:17:51,920 --> 00:17:53,280
It's incredible.

191
00:17:54,240 --> 00:17:56,840
The more I use it, the sharper it gets.

192
00:18:09,400 --> 00:18:12,360
- Was that a person?
- Of course it was a person.

193
00:18:12,440 --> 00:18:14,080
I hope he wasn't a teetotaler,

194
00:18:14,160 --> 00:18:15,640
because we're low on wine.

195
00:18:19,560 --> 00:18:22,960
On the upper levels,
you can eat anything you like.

196
00:18:23,800 --> 00:18:26,080
But you've nothing to look forward to.

197
00:18:27,160 --> 00:18:28,920
And a lot to think about.

198
00:18:38,880 --> 00:18:40,680
Is no one going to do anything?

199
00:18:50,040 --> 00:18:53,200
If I were you, I'd pray they keep us
on the middle levels.

200
00:18:54,040 --> 00:18:57,560
You look like the sort who'd jump
when they're up above

201
00:18:57,640 --> 00:19:00,440
and lack the guts when they're below.

202
00:19:02,600 --> 00:19:04,040
The guts to do what?

203
00:19:14,280 --> 00:19:16,280
Will you read your book to me tonight?

204
00:19:17,160 --> 00:19:19,120
These days, I can't get to sleep.

205
00:19:19,800 --> 00:19:21,120
I miss my television.

206
00:19:23,520 --> 00:19:25,160
What levels have you been on?

207
00:19:27,880 --> 00:19:29,760
I first woke up on Level 72.

208
00:19:31,240 --> 00:19:33,880
Then I was on 26,

209
00:19:33,960 --> 00:19:36,560
seventy-eight, 43,

210
00:19:37,280 --> 00:19:40,880
eleven, 79,

211
00:19:40,960 --> 00:19:44,280
thirty-two, 8...

212
00:19:45,440 --> 00:19:48,000
Last month, I was on Level 132,

213
00:19:48,880 --> 00:19:51,440
- and now, I'm here.
- Okay, and who were you with?

214
00:19:51,520 --> 00:19:54,280
because I gather you always wake up
with the same person.

215
00:19:54,360 --> 00:19:57,400
- Who were you with?
- Why do you gather that?

216
00:19:57,480 --> 00:20:00,920
Because you said we'd be together
next month. Who were you with?

217
00:20:03,200 --> 00:20:06,720
It doesn't matter. What matters is
that you have a self-sharpening knife,

218
00:20:06,800 --> 00:20:07,960
and your cellmate disappeared

219
00:20:08,000 --> 00:20:10,320
after you were on a level
that gets hardly any food.

220
00:20:10,400 --> 00:20:13,040
And you don't look like
you spent a month without food.

221
00:20:13,960 --> 00:20:15,600
The conclusion is obvious, isn't it?

222
00:20:15,680 --> 00:20:18,080
You promised not to use that word again.

223
00:20:18,160 --> 00:20:20,120
Obviously, you forgot
the fifth commandment.

224
00:20:20,200 --> 00:20:22,200
Obviously, you dined on your cellmate.

225
00:20:38,760 --> 00:20:40,560
Don't worry about her. Eat.

226
00:20:40,640 --> 00:20:42,640
- Is she injured?
- Nothing serious.

227
00:20:44,080 --> 00:20:45,360
Isn't that right, Miharu?

228
00:20:50,040 --> 00:20:51,320
You know her?

229
00:20:52,240 --> 00:20:53,880
She comes down every month.

230
00:20:54,800 --> 00:20:57,400
- Why does she do that?
- She's looking for her little boy.

231
00:20:58,800 --> 00:21:00,360
There are children in the hole?

232
00:21:13,480 --> 00:21:17,480
Well, well... So, you'd like to keep her
for a couple of days?

233
00:21:18,920 --> 00:21:21,000
I took you for a man of principles.

234
00:21:21,080 --> 00:21:22,240
I want to help her.

235
00:21:22,880 --> 00:21:24,440
I am helping her.

236
00:21:25,960 --> 00:21:28,920
In the hole, everyone's free to decide
what they want.

237
00:21:29,000 --> 00:21:30,320
She wants to go down.

238
00:21:31,400 --> 00:21:33,680
Know what she does each month?

239
00:21:33,760 --> 00:21:36,960
Before coming down on the platform,
she kills her cellmate.

240
00:21:38,400 --> 00:21:41,440
That way, there's a chance she might be
with her son the next month.

241
00:21:42,240 --> 00:21:46,440
I wouldn't be surprised
if that body you saw was her cellmate.

242
00:21:49,960 --> 00:21:52,040
I didn't kill anyone on Level 132.

243
00:21:52,120 --> 00:21:55,760
Quite simply, my cellmate
completed his time in the hole.

244
00:21:56,640 --> 00:22:00,320
He'll be out there now,
making it big with his accredited diploma.

245
00:22:02,040 --> 00:22:06,120
After eight days, a body fell
just when the platform was at our level.

246
00:22:07,640 --> 00:22:09,360
We ate human flesh.

247
00:22:10,040 --> 00:22:11,720
But we didn't kill anybody.

248
00:22:28,240 --> 00:22:30,040
Hey!

249
00:22:30,320 --> 00:22:31,920
Hey! Hey!

250
00:22:32,360 --> 00:22:34,040
Leave her alone, you bastards!

251
00:22:34,120 --> 00:22:36,960
They'll only keep her a couple of days.
Don't meddle.

252
00:22:37,960 --> 00:22:40,000
- Will you read from your book tonight...
- Hey!

253
00:22:41,920 --> 00:22:44,720
Go ahead! Jump!

254
00:22:44,800 --> 00:22:47,120
It's only six or seven meters down.

255
00:23:14,360 --> 00:23:16,320
What chapter do you want me to read?

256
00:23:16,400 --> 00:23:18,280
Chapter One, obviously.

257
00:23:22,760 --> 00:23:23,760
Jesus!

258
00:23:24,400 --> 00:23:27,520
"Somewhere in La Mancha, in a place
whose name I do not care to remember,

259
00:23:27,600 --> 00:23:30,800
a gentleman lived not long ago,
one of those who has a lance

260
00:23:30,880 --> 00:23:33,640
an old shield, a nag and a racing dog."

261
00:24:42,760 --> 00:24:44,440
Do you believe in God?

262
00:24:48,280 --> 00:24:49,720
Why do you ask?

263
00:24:51,000 --> 00:24:54,480
If you do, I want you to pray for us.

264
00:24:55,920 --> 00:24:57,720
Smell that?

265
00:24:58,640 --> 00:25:00,240
It's gas.

266
00:25:01,040 --> 00:25:03,440
In a moment, they'll put us to sleep.

267
00:25:03,520 --> 00:25:06,240
Tomorrow, we'll wake on another level.

268
00:25:09,040 --> 00:25:10,640
I'm fond of you, Goreng.

269
00:25:11,800 --> 00:25:14,360
I don't think you'll survive long.

270
00:25:15,200 --> 00:25:16,680
But I'm fond of you.

271
00:25:18,880 --> 00:25:20,280
You've got a good heart.

272
00:25:22,560 --> 00:25:25,120
Next month will be my second-to-last.

273
00:25:26,400 --> 00:25:30,600
When I get out,
I should have an accredited diploma.

274
00:25:33,120 --> 00:25:34,960
And that's no small matter.

275
00:25:37,720 --> 00:25:39,040
Do you believe in God?

276
00:25:40,360 --> 00:25:43,840
This month, yes.

277
00:26:12,240 --> 00:26:14,160
You sleep very soundly, Goreng.

278
00:26:17,640 --> 00:26:19,720
Don't worry, don't worry.

279
00:26:19,800 --> 00:26:21,440
Calm down.

280
00:26:25,280 --> 00:26:28,640
This is not a good place.
Do you understand now?

281
00:26:29,480 --> 00:26:32,240
You're younger and stronger than me.

282
00:26:33,640 --> 00:26:36,120
You might not attack me immediately,

283
00:26:36,640 --> 00:26:39,560
but over time,
you'd start to look at me differently.

284
00:26:39,640 --> 00:26:42,080
Hunger unleashes that madman in us.

285
00:26:43,160 --> 00:26:46,840
It's better to eat than be eaten.

286
00:26:48,600 --> 00:26:50,760
Obviously, I don't want to kill you.

287
00:26:50,840 --> 00:26:53,840
Your flesh would soon rot,

288
00:26:53,920 --> 00:26:56,120
and we'd have nothing to eat.

289
00:26:56,560 --> 00:26:58,720
Nor will I mutilate you right away.

290
00:27:00,200 --> 00:27:04,120
For the first week, fasting is bearable.

291
00:27:05,680 --> 00:27:07,800
Have you ever eaten snails?

292
00:27:11,280 --> 00:27:13,440
Refined people call them escargots.

293
00:27:13,520 --> 00:27:16,120
They're highly prized in some places.

294
00:27:16,640 --> 00:27:20,040
Before you eat them, you have
to purge them for seven to ten days.

295
00:27:21,360 --> 00:27:24,080
So, there's no need to be scared. Yet.

296
00:27:29,200 --> 00:27:30,600
Can you hear that?

297
00:27:33,160 --> 00:27:35,040
The screams of people waking

298
00:27:35,760 --> 00:27:38,000
to discover what level they're on.

299
00:27:47,320 --> 00:27:49,440
You don't have to do this, Trimagasi.

300
00:27:50,080 --> 00:27:53,840
As time goes by,
our friendship would deteriorate.

301
00:27:53,920 --> 00:27:56,720
And it would end in mutual mistrust,

302
00:27:56,800 --> 00:27:59,640
ultimately leading to conflict and crime.

303
00:28:00,320 --> 00:28:03,200
I know, because I've experienced it.

304
00:28:03,280 --> 00:28:04,920
You're a fucking murderer.

305
00:28:05,000 --> 00:28:08,440
No. I'm someone who's frightened.

306
00:28:10,080 --> 00:28:12,520
I don't enjoy this, my little snail.

307
00:28:15,040 --> 00:28:17,160
I'm not a fucking snail.

308
00:28:17,240 --> 00:28:20,960
I'm sorry. It's easier for me
to think of you as a snail

309
00:28:21,040 --> 00:28:23,400
purging its impurities.

310
00:28:23,480 --> 00:28:26,800
You see, I'm really quite sentimental.

311
00:28:36,640 --> 00:28:37,640
See that?

312
00:28:39,200 --> 00:28:42,400
They haven't even left us any bones!

313
00:28:46,120 --> 00:28:47,560
Let's see, my little snail,

314
00:28:47,640 --> 00:28:50,240
you're tied down. I'm not.

315
00:28:50,320 --> 00:28:54,440
You have a book. I have my Samurai-Plus.

316
00:28:55,120 --> 00:28:57,760
Obviously, you're in no position
to make demands.

317
00:28:57,840 --> 00:28:59,440
But if you cooperate,

318
00:28:59,520 --> 00:29:02,040
I can offer you a chance to live.

319
00:29:04,040 --> 00:29:07,920
You can't mutilate someone here
without killing them, you bastard.

320
00:29:09,120 --> 00:29:11,200
I promise, I'll do what I can.

321
00:29:12,240 --> 00:29:15,360
After eight days, I'll start cutting off
little strips of flesh.

322
00:29:15,440 --> 00:29:18,800
Each time, I'll do my best
to treat your wounds.

323
00:29:19,400 --> 00:29:21,000
And I'll give you your share.

324
00:29:21,080 --> 00:29:22,480
A share of myself?

325
00:29:22,560 --> 00:29:25,280
Think of your own survival and help me.

326
00:29:25,960 --> 00:29:27,960
I hope you'll see reason,

327
00:29:28,040 --> 00:29:31,200
and we can go on reading <i>Don Quixote.</i>

328
00:29:31,280 --> 00:29:34,960
Let's see. That person's death
might have been an accident,

329
00:29:35,400 --> 00:29:37,000
but this isn't.

330
00:29:37,080 --> 00:29:40,560
You will be solely responsible
for my death, you bastard.

331
00:29:40,640 --> 00:29:44,320
No. The people above make me do it.

332
00:29:44,880 --> 00:29:47,800
Three hundred and forty people
are to blame before me.

333
00:29:48,200 --> 00:29:50,680
We can survive
just by drinking water, Trimagasi.

334
00:29:50,760 --> 00:29:53,080
You might last out,

335
00:29:53,840 --> 00:29:56,040
but I'm an old man.

336
00:29:56,120 --> 00:29:59,520
I need to remember that next month
will be my last one here.

337
00:29:59,600 --> 00:30:04,720
And if I survive... what happens
if we're sent to another bad level?

338
00:30:04,800 --> 00:30:07,840
- Now you get it, don't you?
- Obviously not.

339
00:30:07,920 --> 00:30:11,080
- Will you read <i>Don Quixote</i> to me tonight?
- Obviously not.

340
00:30:11,160 --> 00:30:12,760
In that case, that's an end to it.

341
00:30:12,840 --> 00:30:14,600
Speaking tires me out.

342
00:30:14,680 --> 00:30:17,240
Keeping quiet tires you out!

343
00:30:17,320 --> 00:30:18,720
Keeping quiet tires you out!

344
00:31:06,000 --> 00:31:08,160
The time has come, my little snail.

345
00:31:09,520 --> 00:31:11,200
I was trying to read...

346
00:31:12,040 --> 00:31:13,600
but I can't.

347
00:31:14,200 --> 00:31:16,080
The words get mixed up.

348
00:31:17,680 --> 00:31:19,840
My mind clouds over.

349
00:31:23,200 --> 00:31:25,240
Better for you if we start today.

350
00:31:26,360 --> 00:31:30,040
Otherwise, I can't guarantee
to make a clean job of it.

351
00:31:31,760 --> 00:31:35,400
I want you to know
that I hold you responsible.

352
00:31:36,520 --> 00:31:38,200
Not the people up above.

353
00:31:38,920 --> 00:31:40,560
Not the circumstances.

354
00:31:41,160 --> 00:31:43,000
Not even the Administration.

355
00:31:46,680 --> 00:31:47,720
You.

356
00:31:49,320 --> 00:31:51,760
You're well purged, my little snail.

357
00:31:53,040 --> 00:31:54,880
Inside and out.

358
00:31:55,640 --> 00:31:57,400
You don't even feel any resentment.

359
00:31:59,000 --> 00:32:02,360
Don't worry, just a few morsels of flesh.

360
00:32:02,440 --> 00:32:04,360
I won't touch your genitals.

361
00:32:08,040 --> 00:32:09,640
Are you ready?

362
00:35:13,840 --> 00:35:15,200
Thank you.

363
00:35:55,880 --> 00:35:57,280
What's your boy called?

364
00:37:13,360 --> 00:37:14,360
Eat...

365
00:37:15,760 --> 00:37:17,280
or be eaten?

366
00:37:21,440 --> 00:37:23,160
You made me.

367
00:37:23,240 --> 00:37:24,560
No.

368
00:37:25,160 --> 00:37:27,560
I was helpless and you showed no mercy.

369
00:37:28,040 --> 00:37:31,720
You didn't treat me with the same respect
I would have shown you.

370
00:37:31,800 --> 00:37:32,800
Obviously.

371
00:37:32,880 --> 00:37:35,400
Still using that word when you're dead.

372
00:37:39,760 --> 00:37:41,200
It smells of gas.

373
00:37:45,040 --> 00:37:46,640
And you're an illusion.

374
00:37:47,520 --> 00:37:48,520
Perhaps.

375
00:37:49,720 --> 00:37:53,080
What does it matter? We're the same now.

376
00:37:56,560 --> 00:37:58,680
Both murderers.

377
00:37:58,760 --> 00:38:01,640
The difference is that I'm more civilized.

378
00:38:03,000 --> 00:38:07,520
- Go.
- No. I'll never go.

379
00:38:08,360 --> 00:38:12,200
I belong to you now. I am in your body.

380
00:38:14,520 --> 00:38:17,800
But you belong to me too,

381
00:38:17,880 --> 00:38:19,360
my snail.

382
00:38:21,640 --> 00:38:23,080
Speaking tires me out.

383
00:38:23,840 --> 00:38:25,800
See? I was right.

384
00:39:21,920 --> 00:39:24,720
Ramesses II! Come here, honey.

385
00:39:27,160 --> 00:39:30,000
Animal! He was only being friendly.

386
00:39:36,520 --> 00:39:39,120
I'm Imoguiri. This is Ramesses II.

387
00:39:39,680 --> 00:39:41,600
Can you bring animals into the hole?

388
00:39:41,680 --> 00:39:44,080
There was no way
I was coming without him, Goreng.

389
00:39:44,160 --> 00:39:47,480
It's not a great idea
to bring a sausage dog in here.

390
00:39:47,560 --> 00:39:49,880
In here, he's more sausage than dog.

391
00:39:49,960 --> 00:39:53,200
I thought someone who chose a book
would be more sensitive with animals.

392
00:39:53,680 --> 00:39:55,600
No one ever brought a book before.

393
00:39:56,800 --> 00:39:59,560
People have asked for everything:
guns, crossbows,

394
00:40:00,200 --> 00:40:01,960
knives, torches,

395
00:40:02,040 --> 00:40:04,720
golf clubs, baseball bats...

396
00:40:04,800 --> 00:40:07,280
- even an exercise bike.
- How do you know my name?

397
00:40:09,400 --> 00:40:11,200
<i>You can smoke if you want.</i>

398
00:40:17,560 --> 00:40:20,400
- Shall we continue?
- Yes.

399
00:40:26,760 --> 00:40:28,360
Any gluten or lactose intolerance?

400
00:40:29,440 --> 00:40:30,440
No.

401
00:40:32,920 --> 00:40:36,880
Any allergy to shellfish, peanuts,
or any type of fruit?

402
00:40:36,960 --> 00:40:39,200
Not that I know of.

403
00:40:53,960 --> 00:40:56,640
You know that once you go in,
you won't be able to smoke?

404
00:41:00,000 --> 00:41:01,320
Yes, I know.

405
00:41:14,840 --> 00:41:16,800
Are these pauses part of the interview?

406
00:41:20,680 --> 00:41:22,000
Do they make you uncomfortable?

407
00:41:23,080 --> 00:41:24,400
No.

408
00:41:33,680 --> 00:41:35,120
Your favorite food?

409
00:41:41,320 --> 00:41:42,400
I don't know.

410
00:41:45,880 --> 00:41:47,440
Think hard, please.

411
00:41:48,800 --> 00:41:50,360
Why do you want to know?

412
00:41:51,040 --> 00:41:52,760
We'll include it on the menu.

413
00:41:54,320 --> 00:41:56,080
So, I've been accepted?

414
00:41:57,240 --> 00:41:58,920
Not yet.

415
00:42:03,760 --> 00:42:05,600
Escargots à la Bourguignonne.

416
00:42:07,280 --> 00:42:08,440
Snails?

417
00:42:09,240 --> 00:42:11,440
- Yes.
- Okay.

418
00:42:12,360 --> 00:42:16,120
<i>- Can you get me out of here?
- You know I can't.</i>

419
00:42:17,080 --> 00:42:20,760
How many did you send to this pigsty
before they sent you?

420
00:42:21,480 --> 00:42:24,440
If I remember correctly,
you came here voluntarily.

421
00:42:24,520 --> 00:42:27,840
No one sent me. I asked to be sent too.

422
00:42:27,920 --> 00:42:31,160
So, you don't know
there are people dying in the hole?

423
00:42:31,240 --> 00:42:34,520
We prefer to call it
a Vertical Self-Management Center.

424
00:42:40,080 --> 00:42:41,640
How many levels are there?

425
00:42:43,040 --> 00:42:44,560
Two hundred levels.

426
00:42:48,160 --> 00:42:49,520
Two hundred?

427
00:42:53,160 --> 00:42:56,040
There isn't enough food for 200 levels.

428
00:42:56,760 --> 00:42:59,120
If everyone ate only what they needed,

429
00:42:59,800 --> 00:43:01,640
the food would reach the lowest levels.

430
00:43:01,720 --> 00:43:05,320
- No, it's not that easy in here.
- No, it isn't.

431
00:43:05,400 --> 00:43:06,680
Or on the outside.

432
00:43:06,760 --> 00:43:09,720
But eventually,
something has to happen in the VSC.

433
00:43:09,800 --> 00:43:13,440
Something that fosters
a spontaneous sense of solidarity.

434
00:43:13,520 --> 00:43:16,600
The VSC? Spontaneous solidarity?

435
00:43:16,680 --> 00:43:19,280
Is that why they created this pit?

436
00:43:25,280 --> 00:43:28,240
Change never happens spontaneously.

437
00:43:29,600 --> 00:43:31,600
Perhaps, that's why you're here.

438
00:43:41,320 --> 00:43:43,200
I'll be glad just to get out alive.

439
00:44:19,720 --> 00:44:22,440
That's it. Isn't that delicious?

440
00:44:22,520 --> 00:44:25,520
You know that what you're doing
could cause the death of a human?

441
00:44:25,600 --> 00:44:26,760
That's it.

442
00:44:27,960 --> 00:44:31,240
One day, I eat, and the next, he does.
It's my ration.

443
00:44:32,680 --> 00:44:34,400
Maybe the death of a child.

444
00:44:35,760 --> 00:44:38,120
Under-16s aren't allowed in the hole.

445
00:44:41,240 --> 00:44:42,960
There's at least one child.

446
00:44:43,040 --> 00:44:46,480
Under-16s aren't allowed in the hole.

447
00:44:46,560 --> 00:44:49,600
The VSC Administration
is very strict about that.

448
00:45:01,240 --> 00:45:03,000
Good morning.

449
00:45:03,400 --> 00:45:05,080
Please listen carefully.

450
00:45:05,160 --> 00:45:07,400
I've left two helpings to one side

451
00:45:07,480 --> 00:45:09,000
so you can each eat your share.

452
00:45:09,080 --> 00:45:12,120
Please prepare two similar rations
for the people on the next level.

453
00:45:12,200 --> 00:45:16,840
What? We've just been in Level 88.
It's a miracle we're alive!

454
00:45:16,920 --> 00:45:19,280
I understand, but we have
a responsibility to those

455
00:45:19,360 --> 00:45:20,960
less fortunate that us this month.

456
00:45:21,040 --> 00:45:24,000
Your rations contain enough calories
to ensure your survival.

457
00:45:29,280 --> 00:45:30,800
Please, gentlemen!

458
00:45:34,840 --> 00:45:36,480
Spontaneous solidarity.

459
00:45:39,400 --> 00:45:42,600
Perhaps this place exists precisely
for the opposite of what you think.

460
00:45:42,680 --> 00:45:48,000
If that solidarity emerged, they'd know
to prevent it happening on the outside.

461
00:45:48,080 --> 00:45:50,520
- Who's "they"?
- Who do you think?

462
00:45:53,640 --> 00:45:55,040
The Administration.

463
00:45:56,720 --> 00:46:00,920
You're one of those people who thinks
all the Administration does is bad.

464
00:46:01,520 --> 00:46:04,040
I've worked for them for 25 years.

465
00:46:05,080 --> 00:46:07,600
And you enjoy special privileges.

466
00:46:07,680 --> 00:46:10,840
- What are you saying?
- You got to choose your cellmate.

467
00:46:17,680 --> 00:46:18,720
Not me.

468
00:46:36,280 --> 00:46:38,096
Gentlemen, I understand
you were hungry yesterday,

469
00:46:38,120 --> 00:46:39,840
and you didn't pay any notice to me.

470
00:46:39,920 --> 00:46:43,880
But it's important you only eat
the helpings I've prepared.

471
00:46:43,960 --> 00:46:46,960
And make two more for Level 35.

472
00:46:47,640 --> 00:46:49,120
Leave us alone!

473
00:46:49,200 --> 00:46:51,200
We'll eat what we fucking like!

474
00:46:56,640 --> 00:46:58,360
Sooner or later, you will see reason.

475
00:46:59,400 --> 00:47:00,600
Are you real?

476
00:47:00,680 --> 00:47:04,200
<i>Gentlemen, please, eat your rations
and prepare two similar ones for the...</i>

477
00:47:07,160 --> 00:47:08,480
<i>Gentlemen, please,</i>

478
00:47:09,240 --> 00:47:12,040
<i>eat your rations
and prepare two similar ones for the...</i>

479
00:47:14,280 --> 00:47:16,440
<i>Gentlemen, please.</i>

480
00:47:16,960 --> 00:47:20,440
<i>Eat your share
and prepare two similar rations...</i>

481
00:47:21,840 --> 00:47:25,760
<i>Gentlemen, please, eat your rations
and prepare two similar ones...</i>

482
00:47:28,560 --> 00:47:30,880
<i>Gentlemen, I have prepared your rations</i>

483
00:47:30,960 --> 00:47:35,200
<i>and the rations for Level 35
to make things easier for you.</i>

484
00:47:35,280 --> 00:47:37,040
Please prepare two...

485
00:47:39,400 --> 00:47:42,240
Please, it's been two weeks.

486
00:47:42,320 --> 00:47:44,840
This time, please follow my instructions

487
00:47:44,920 --> 00:47:47,760
because there are people dying
beneath your feet.

488
00:47:47,840 --> 00:47:50,360
Do you understand me? People are dying!

489
00:47:51,160 --> 00:47:52,760
Okay, bastards.

490
00:47:53,280 --> 00:47:55,160
You do exactly what the lady says,

491
00:47:55,240 --> 00:47:57,640
or I'm going to shit
in your food every day.

492
00:47:57,880 --> 00:48:00,880
I'll mix it all up till there isn't
a grain of rice left untouched.

493
00:48:00,960 --> 00:48:02,080
Do you hear?

494
00:48:02,200 --> 00:48:03,840
You're going to eat shit every day.

495
00:48:03,920 --> 00:48:07,000
And now, go and say the same
to the bastards beneath you.

496
00:48:07,080 --> 00:48:08,080
Is that clear?

497
00:48:12,040 --> 00:48:13,120
Right.

498
00:48:19,600 --> 00:48:21,440
It seems to be working.

499
00:48:21,520 --> 00:48:22,600
Obviously.

500
00:48:24,240 --> 00:48:26,120
But it's not what I thought.

501
00:48:26,200 --> 00:48:28,000
I thought I'd persuade them.

502
00:48:28,080 --> 00:48:29,200
They're persuaded.

503
00:48:29,280 --> 00:48:30,320
With shit?

504
00:48:30,400 --> 00:48:32,960
Much more effective
than your spontaneous solidarity.

505
00:48:34,600 --> 00:48:36,656
Let's see if now we can persuade
the people up above.

506
00:48:36,680 --> 00:48:38,960
The people above won't listen to me.

507
00:48:40,640 --> 00:48:42,000
Why not?

508
00:48:42,080 --> 00:48:44,160
I can't shit upwards.

509
00:49:00,360 --> 00:49:02,560
Help me! Help me!

510
00:49:08,760 --> 00:49:11,120
Okay, calm down, calm down.

511
00:49:11,200 --> 00:49:12,880
It's the mother of the boy.

512
00:49:16,280 --> 00:49:18,280
The pillow, the pillow!

513
00:49:25,240 --> 00:49:26,560
Don't worry.

514
00:49:37,040 --> 00:49:39,440
Don't worry. It's okay.

515
00:49:42,720 --> 00:49:44,120
- What?
- So cold.

516
00:49:44,200 --> 00:49:45,840
It's cold.

517
00:49:47,080 --> 00:49:48,760
That's it.

518
00:49:48,840 --> 00:49:50,720
I'm cold, too.

519
00:49:53,400 --> 00:49:54,720
What's happening?

520
00:49:56,400 --> 00:49:58,800
Fucking dog. Come here!

521
00:49:58,880 --> 00:50:01,680
Bastard, come here! Let go!

522
00:50:49,800 --> 00:50:52,040
I hate you.

523
00:50:52,120 --> 00:50:53,800
You vile bitch!

524
00:50:53,880 --> 00:50:55,520
- I hate you!
- Hey!

525
00:50:57,000 --> 00:50:59,880
What? What?

526
00:51:18,600 --> 00:51:20,000
It's because of her son.

527
00:51:23,600 --> 00:51:26,040
Seriously? I don't know.

528
00:51:27,160 --> 00:51:28,800
I've never been a mother.

529
00:51:28,880 --> 00:51:31,360
Hey! Is this our helping for today?

530
00:51:31,440 --> 00:51:33,280
That's fucking ace, man.

531
00:51:34,000 --> 00:51:37,400
I selected that woman ten months ago,
and she came here alone.

532
00:51:38,160 --> 00:51:40,280
She has no father and no children.

533
00:51:40,360 --> 00:51:42,280
Her favorite dish is bibimbap.

534
00:51:43,120 --> 00:51:46,400
She's a movie actress.
She brought a ukulele.

535
00:51:46,480 --> 00:51:49,400
She wanted to look like Marilyn Monroe
in the film.

536
00:51:49,480 --> 00:51:51,160
She came into the hole on her own.

537
00:51:51,840 --> 00:51:53,440
You hear, Goreng?

538
00:51:54,200 --> 00:51:57,480
Completely alone.

539
00:52:01,640 --> 00:52:05,480
The bitch wanted to be
the Asian Marilyn Monroe.

540
00:52:06,640 --> 00:52:08,760
With her slit eyes, playing the ukulele...

541
00:52:08,840 --> 00:52:12,080
And now she's a crazed killer
looking for a non-existent child.

542
00:52:14,840 --> 00:52:16,920
A spontaneous act of solidarity.

543
00:52:17,600 --> 00:52:20,040
Solidarity covered in shit.

544
00:52:24,400 --> 00:52:27,680
This isn't a great place
for someone who likes books.

545
00:52:29,240 --> 00:52:32,000
I've worked for them for 25 years.

546
00:52:32,560 --> 00:52:34,680
For eight years,
I've sent people to this hell.

547
00:52:34,760 --> 00:52:37,760
I didn't know what I was doing,
because I didn't know.

548
00:52:39,920 --> 00:52:41,760
I swear I didn't know.

549
00:52:44,200 --> 00:52:45,800
Do you believe me, Goreng?

550
00:52:47,880 --> 00:52:49,840
You don't believe me, do you?

551
00:52:50,920 --> 00:52:53,680
Right now, I need you to believe me.

552
00:52:58,680 --> 00:53:03,640
Look at me, Goreng.
I fought cancer for three years.

553
00:53:03,720 --> 00:53:06,400
And the day I found out
I'd lost the fight...

554
00:53:08,760 --> 00:53:11,160
I applied to come here, to help.

555
00:53:19,520 --> 00:53:20,800
But you know something?

556
00:53:22,280 --> 00:53:24,280
That doesn't matter anymore.

557
00:53:25,360 --> 00:53:26,600
I don't care anymore.

558
00:53:27,440 --> 00:53:29,160
I don't care about anything anymore.

559
00:53:32,560 --> 00:53:34,560
Who the hell would bring a book here?

560
00:53:35,560 --> 00:53:39,760
Who the hell would bring
a fucking book here?

561
00:55:06,000 --> 00:55:08,240
Look, it's a miracle
nobody's touched the snails.

562
00:55:14,600 --> 00:55:16,080
Don't you want to eat something?

563
00:55:20,560 --> 00:55:22,400
I'll put a couple in each helping, okay?

564
00:55:30,360 --> 00:55:32,680
Imoguiri, why don't you eat a bit?

565
00:55:34,120 --> 00:55:36,800
It's Ramesses II's turn today.

566
00:55:41,920 --> 00:55:45,080
It's the last day, you should eat.

567
00:55:55,200 --> 00:55:57,320
We don't know where we'll be tomorrow.

568
00:56:47,200 --> 00:56:48,960
Aren't you going to take her down?

569
00:56:49,640 --> 00:56:50,960
You were her friend.

570
00:56:53,560 --> 00:56:55,040
Are you going to eat her?

571
00:56:55,120 --> 00:56:57,760
Of course you are, Goreng.
Why do you think I hung myself?

572
00:56:57,840 --> 00:57:01,160
It would have been much easier to jump,
like most people do.

573
00:57:01,240 --> 00:57:03,080
But I wanted to leave you a gift.

574
00:57:04,480 --> 00:57:05,480
My body.

575
00:57:06,520 --> 00:57:08,720
I want you to feed off my body, Goreng.

576
00:57:08,800 --> 00:57:11,760
I want you to digest it,
then flush it out like redeeming shit.

577
00:57:11,840 --> 00:57:15,040
Remember: solidarity or shit.

578
00:57:15,120 --> 00:57:18,080
Do you think covering your ears
will do any good?

579
00:57:18,160 --> 00:57:20,840
We're inside your head, you idiot!

580
00:57:20,920 --> 00:57:23,280
Did you call him an idiot, idiot?

581
00:57:23,360 --> 00:57:25,080
You're talking to the Messiah.

582
00:57:25,160 --> 00:57:28,240
The Messiah of Shit,
but still the Messiah.

583
00:57:29,200 --> 00:57:31,840
- Eat me, Goreng.
<i>- The madwoman is right.</i>

584
00:57:31,920 --> 00:57:34,480
<i>It's your only chance of survival.</i>

585
00:57:34,560 --> 00:57:38,600
<i>That's right. Cut slices of my flesh
and eat my body.</i>

586
00:57:38,680 --> 00:57:40,000
Oh, Savior!

587
00:57:41,360 --> 00:57:42,800
<i>"Verily I say unto you:</i>

588
00:57:42,880 --> 00:57:46,440
<i>If you eat not the flesh of the Son of Man
nor drink of his blood,</i>

589
00:57:46,520 --> 00:57:48,160
<i>ye have no life.</i>

590
00:57:48,240 --> 00:57:50,360
He that eateth my flesh
and drinketh my blood

591
00:57:50,440 --> 00:57:52,280
<i>hath eternal life.</i>

592
00:57:52,360 --> 00:57:54,720
<i>I will raise him up at the last day.</i>

593
00:57:55,760 --> 00:57:57,600
<i>For my flesh is meat indeed,</i>

594
00:57:57,680 --> 00:57:59,880
and my blood is drink indeed.

595
00:58:00,440 --> 00:58:03,000
<i>He that eateth my flesh
and drinketh my blood</i>

596
00:58:03,080 --> 00:58:04,680
<i>dwelleth in me,</i>

597
00:58:04,760 --> 00:58:05,760
and I in him."

598
00:58:07,040 --> 00:58:08,120
Amen.

599
00:59:28,240 --> 00:59:29,480
Here, Goreng.

600
00:59:30,000 --> 00:59:32,920
With a Samurai-Plus,
it was like cutting butter.

601
00:59:36,760 --> 00:59:38,080
Do it.

602
00:59:59,800 --> 01:00:03,640
Ears, cheek, jowl...

603
01:00:03,720 --> 01:00:07,720
breast, ribs, belly...

604
01:00:07,800 --> 01:00:11,000
brisket, trotters, knuckle...

605
01:00:11,080 --> 01:00:13,320
shoulder, ham...

606
01:00:13,400 --> 01:00:15,320
loin, chops.

607
01:00:49,000 --> 01:00:51,880
You, up there! Bastards.

608
01:00:51,960 --> 01:00:55,800
Come on! I know you're there!

609
01:00:55,880 --> 01:00:59,880
My name is Baharat, and I'm on fire!
You're here!

610
01:01:00,520 --> 01:01:02,080
Have you seen what level we're on?

611
01:01:02,160 --> 01:01:03,920
Level six, my friend!

612
01:01:04,000 --> 01:01:06,200
I'm on fire! I'm on fire! I'm on fire!

613
01:01:06,280 --> 01:01:08,400
I can get to the top from here! Hey!

614
01:01:08,480 --> 01:01:11,280
You, in No. 5, answer me!
Come on, answer me!

615
01:01:11,360 --> 01:01:14,360
- What's up? You want to come up?
- Yes, I want to come up.

616
01:01:14,440 --> 01:01:16,640
- What do you want to come up for?
- What for?

617
01:01:16,960 --> 01:01:19,320
To get out of this fucking hell!

618
01:01:20,680 --> 01:01:23,320
- Do you believe in God?
- Yes.

619
01:01:24,080 --> 01:01:25,760
Yes, I believe in God.

620
01:01:26,880 --> 01:01:29,000
But what God do you believe in?

621
01:01:30,400 --> 01:01:31,800
In the One God.

622
01:01:33,080 --> 01:01:35,000
In the One True God!

623
01:01:36,160 --> 01:01:38,760
He says he believes
in the same God as us, darling.

624
01:01:38,840 --> 01:01:41,360
Come on!
I'm just passing through, I promise.

625
01:01:41,440 --> 01:01:44,280
God told me to get out of the hole!

626
01:01:45,120 --> 01:01:46,920
He says God has spoken to him.

627
01:01:47,000 --> 01:01:49,120
And what did he say exactly?

628
01:01:49,200 --> 01:01:53,200
That two pious souls
would help me get out of the hole!

629
01:01:53,280 --> 01:01:56,080
Did you hear that, darling?
I think God was talking about us.

630
01:01:56,160 --> 01:01:59,480
And he will reward you for this!

631
01:02:01,560 --> 01:02:04,320
And how will God reward us?

632
01:02:05,080 --> 01:02:07,080
With everlasting life!

633
01:02:07,160 --> 01:02:08,960
Everlasting life, no less!

634
01:02:09,040 --> 01:02:11,560
Not a bad exchange
for helping a black man.

635
01:02:11,640 --> 01:02:13,000
Come on, let me up!

636
01:02:19,640 --> 01:02:21,600
Throw up the rope. We'll help you.

637
01:02:21,680 --> 01:02:25,360
Thank you, brothers! Praise the Lord!

638
01:02:29,640 --> 01:02:31,920
See you on the outside. Got it?

639
01:02:46,040 --> 01:02:47,560
Help me!

640
01:02:50,480 --> 01:02:51,920
Help me!

641
01:02:59,880 --> 01:03:01,840
Bastards!

642
01:03:01,920 --> 01:03:03,000
Pigs!

643
01:03:03,080 --> 01:03:04,480
The bitch shat on me!

644
01:03:04,560 --> 01:03:06,200
Pray for a rope to your God!

645
01:03:07,000 --> 01:03:09,320
The rope! My rope!

646
01:03:14,040 --> 01:03:16,280
You're fine. Be optimistic.

647
01:03:16,360 --> 01:03:18,160
You're screwed.

648
01:03:19,920 --> 01:03:21,720
You're screwed!

649
01:03:23,400 --> 01:03:25,320
Five, five...

650
01:03:26,680 --> 01:03:29,400
You'll never get that close.

651
01:03:30,160 --> 01:03:32,440
Five fucking levels!

652
01:04:47,520 --> 01:04:49,960
You're adapting very well, my snail.

653
01:04:51,640 --> 01:04:53,720
I attacked you.

654
01:04:54,440 --> 01:04:56,800
The mad witch committed suicide.

655
01:04:57,440 --> 01:05:00,760
Now, you can recover fully in this level,

656
01:05:00,840 --> 01:05:02,640
eating everything.

657
01:05:04,160 --> 01:05:07,160
You'll have just one more month

658
01:05:07,240 --> 01:05:10,120
before you get out with your diploma.

659
01:05:11,040 --> 01:05:13,480
See? It wasn't that difficult.

660
01:05:15,360 --> 01:05:17,320
It's just up to you now...

661
01:05:18,920 --> 01:05:20,560
just you.

662
01:05:24,120 --> 01:05:27,280
Change never happens spontaneously, ma'am.

663
01:05:28,560 --> 01:05:30,760
Maybe that's why you are here.

664
01:05:45,800 --> 01:05:47,280
Help me down.

665
01:05:53,520 --> 01:05:55,000
We use whatever weapons we can.

666
01:05:56,200 --> 01:06:00,240
We get onto the platform and hand out food
at every level, just enough to survive.

667
01:06:02,800 --> 01:06:03,880
What?

668
01:06:04,720 --> 01:06:06,640
I can't manage it on my own...

669
01:06:07,360 --> 01:06:09,120
but we can do it together.

670
01:06:10,840 --> 01:06:13,360
Together, we have a chance, Baharat.

671
01:06:15,480 --> 01:06:17,760
I'll try getting up next month.

672
01:06:19,720 --> 01:06:22,440
There'll always be some bastard
who won't let you past.

673
01:06:23,360 --> 01:06:25,240
Going down is suicide.

674
01:06:25,320 --> 01:06:29,240
If we can get food to the last level,
we'll have broken the machinery.

675
01:06:30,160 --> 01:06:32,680
The hole doesn't have machinery.

676
01:06:33,520 --> 01:06:35,000
The hole is the hole.

677
01:06:35,760 --> 01:06:37,400
The hole is a prison.

678
01:06:38,440 --> 01:06:41,240
We don't know how many levels there are.

679
01:06:41,320 --> 01:06:44,400
When I was at Level 202,
I counted, second by second,

680
01:06:45,200 --> 01:06:47,760
the time the platform took
to come back up.

681
01:06:47,840 --> 01:06:49,240
It's not very exact,

682
01:06:49,320 --> 01:06:52,440
but by calculating the time
the platform stops at each level...

683
01:06:55,160 --> 01:06:57,720
I reckon there are around 250.

684
01:06:58,880 --> 01:07:02,720
- Two hundred and fifty?
- Two hundred and fifty.

685
01:07:05,560 --> 01:07:07,520
What if you're wrong?

686
01:07:08,200 --> 01:07:11,320
What if we run out of food
and haven't got to the bottom?

687
01:07:12,080 --> 01:07:15,240
Then we stay on the platform
and go back up on it.

688
01:07:16,000 --> 01:07:17,200
Just like you wanted to.

689
01:07:18,680 --> 01:07:21,560
- Go down...
- To go up.

690
01:07:21,640 --> 01:07:24,720
Only a lunatic would leave Level 6.

691
01:07:25,720 --> 01:07:27,560
Or two lunatics on fire.

692
01:07:56,520 --> 01:07:58,160
You're ridiculous up there.

693
01:07:58,240 --> 01:08:00,880
I hope they kill you both, assholes.

694
01:08:29,960 --> 01:08:31,920
You! Get out of here!

695
01:08:32,000 --> 01:08:33,760
Keep well back from the platform!

696
01:08:33,840 --> 01:08:35,880
Baharat! What the hell are you doing?

697
01:08:35,960 --> 01:08:38,320
Relax, we're just passing through.

698
01:08:38,400 --> 01:08:42,000
- We'll give you your rations and go.
- No.

699
01:08:43,760 --> 01:08:45,400
- No?
- No.

700
01:08:45,840 --> 01:08:47,640
The first 50 levels eat every day.

701
01:08:47,720 --> 01:08:49,400
We start handing out food on Level 51.

702
01:08:49,480 --> 01:08:53,320
These two are friends of mine.
Two months ago, they helped me climb.

703
01:08:53,400 --> 01:08:55,640
These two ate yesterday,
and they'll eat tomorrow.

704
01:08:56,200 --> 01:08:57,840
A day without food won't kill them.

705
01:08:57,920 --> 01:09:01,240
No way! I'm on Level 7,
and I'm entitled to stuff my face.

706
01:09:01,320 --> 01:09:03,120
I nearly died last month on Level 114.

707
01:09:03,200 --> 01:09:05,200
Where were you then, you bastards?

708
01:09:05,280 --> 01:09:06,880
Then, you should understand.

709
01:09:06,960 --> 01:09:08,880
What are you? Some sort of Messiah?

710
01:09:08,960 --> 01:09:10,440
A Messiah who has come to save us?

711
01:09:10,520 --> 01:09:14,520
A Messiah would multiply the loaves
and fishes, not take them from our mouths.

712
01:09:16,080 --> 01:09:18,120
This is crap, Baharat. Christ!

713
01:09:18,200 --> 01:09:19,680
I didn't expect this of you.

714
01:09:19,760 --> 01:09:23,960
Who are you?
The black servant of a white man?

715
01:09:35,760 --> 01:09:38,000
You! Get into the fucking corner!

716
01:09:38,080 --> 01:09:40,640
Hey! I'll kill you!

717
01:09:40,720 --> 01:09:43,080
Into the corner. Don't move!

718
01:09:44,040 --> 01:09:47,360
Into the corner! Don't mess with me!

719
01:09:47,440 --> 01:09:49,800
You! Drop that! Drop that!

720
01:09:50,240 --> 01:09:52,640
On the ground! Don't move!

721
01:09:53,120 --> 01:09:54,360
Out! Or I'll crush you!

722
01:09:54,680 --> 01:09:56,720
You! If you come close, you're dead!

723
01:09:56,800 --> 01:09:57,880
Baharat!

724
01:10:03,840 --> 01:10:04,960
Sorry, sir.

725
01:10:05,040 --> 01:10:08,080
Get off there right now!

726
01:10:08,160 --> 01:10:11,600
You idiots are standing on the food.

727
01:10:13,800 --> 01:10:15,360
Who the hell is this guy?

728
01:10:16,440 --> 01:10:17,880
A wise man.

729
01:10:17,960 --> 01:10:22,120
Did I teach you nothing?

730
01:10:22,200 --> 01:10:25,600
Sir, we are trying to make sure
that food gets to every level.

731
01:10:26,200 --> 01:10:28,480
That's good.

732
01:10:29,400 --> 01:10:34,040
Very good. But manners come first.

733
01:10:34,120 --> 01:10:37,040
Win them over before you hit them.

734
01:10:37,120 --> 01:10:39,840
Sure, but what if we can't?

735
01:10:39,920 --> 01:10:43,920
Then, hit them hard.
But dialogue must come first.

736
01:10:44,920 --> 01:10:46,480
However...

737
01:10:46,560 --> 01:10:51,560
who up there will know if you succeed?

738
01:10:53,960 --> 01:10:55,360
The Administration?

739
01:10:57,480 --> 01:11:01,720
The Administration has no conscience.

740
01:11:01,800 --> 01:11:06,120
However, there is a slim chance

741
01:11:06,200 --> 01:11:09,800
the people working on Level 0 do.

742
01:11:09,880 --> 01:11:13,000
That's where you must send your message.

743
01:11:13,080 --> 01:11:15,280
And how do we do that?

744
01:11:28,800 --> 01:11:30,680
With a symbol.

745
01:11:31,320 --> 01:11:34,040
We need a delicious,

746
01:11:34,120 --> 01:11:38,520
perfectly presented dish.

747
01:11:38,600 --> 01:11:43,400
A luxury dish
that gets back to Level 0 untouched.

748
01:11:51,200 --> 01:11:53,840
<i>Imagine their faces</i>

749
01:11:53,920 --> 01:11:58,680
<i>when they see the hole send back
a dish like that.</i>

750
01:11:59,600 --> 01:12:03,680
<i>Then they will understand the message.</i>

751
01:12:05,720 --> 01:12:07,320
<i>The panna cotta.</i>

752
01:12:07,400 --> 01:12:12,240
<i>You must preserve the panna cotta,
as if your life depended on it.</i>

753
01:12:13,000 --> 01:12:15,880
<i>The panna cotta is the message.</i>

754
01:12:19,480 --> 01:12:20,640
Friends,

755
01:12:21,240 --> 01:12:24,680
I ask you please not to approach
the platform.

756
01:12:24,760 --> 01:12:27,080
We want you to join

757
01:12:27,160 --> 01:12:29,200
a peaceful protest movement

758
01:12:29,280 --> 01:12:32,520
that will inexorably change
the course of events

759
01:12:32,600 --> 01:12:34,400
and set an important precedent...

760
01:12:34,480 --> 01:12:36,520
What? Speak properly, asshole!

761
01:12:36,600 --> 01:12:39,240
- We want you to go hungry for a day.
- A day without food?

762
01:12:39,840 --> 01:12:40,840
Yes.

763
01:12:42,760 --> 01:12:44,280
Fuck that!

764
01:12:51,000 --> 01:12:53,120
The important thing is the message.

765
01:13:05,120 --> 01:13:06,440
Out!

766
01:13:16,480 --> 01:13:19,600
Another couple of levels,
and we start handing out food.

767
01:13:19,680 --> 01:13:20,680
Back!

768
01:13:23,840 --> 01:13:26,720
We don't want trouble, friends.
We're just passing through.

769
01:13:26,800 --> 01:13:29,680
We'll give you your ration and go.

770
01:14:04,880 --> 01:14:07,760
- He's going to die.
- Not if you look after him.

771
01:14:07,840 --> 01:14:09,680
He's going to die anyway.

772
01:14:11,240 --> 01:14:13,320
I'll smother him with the pillow.

773
01:14:15,720 --> 01:14:17,920
Eat up and don't talk nonsense.

774
01:14:18,400 --> 01:14:21,960
I'll slit open his belly,
and I'll eat what you've given him.

775
01:14:36,160 --> 01:14:37,400
Jesus!

776
01:14:37,960 --> 01:14:39,520
This must be where Miharu woke up.

777
01:14:39,600 --> 01:14:42,200
- The mother of the child?
- That child that doesn't exist.

778
01:14:42,280 --> 01:14:43,280
Fuck.

779
01:14:44,160 --> 01:14:45,160
Shit.

780
01:14:46,640 --> 01:14:49,000
Shit! Shit!

781
01:14:50,040 --> 01:14:51,600
The platform didn't stop.

782
01:14:52,320 --> 01:14:55,680
That means there are more levels
than you counted.

783
01:15:00,280 --> 01:15:02,080
Shit...

784
01:15:02,160 --> 01:15:05,480
If there's nobody alive,
the platform doesn't stop.

785
01:15:05,560 --> 01:15:09,120
Shit. Shit. Shit.

786
01:15:13,920 --> 01:15:15,760
Miharu! Miharu!

787
01:16:29,680 --> 01:16:30,960
She's dead.

788
01:16:32,320 --> 01:16:34,720
No! No!

789
01:16:35,320 --> 01:16:36,320
She is dead!

790
01:16:36,321 --> 01:16:39,041
The platform! Let's go!

791
01:16:39,840 --> 01:16:41,360
Let's go!

792
01:16:41,440 --> 01:16:43,360
The platform!

793
01:17:09,760 --> 01:17:11,080
Get back!

794
01:17:56,720 --> 01:17:58,400
Be strong.

795
01:17:58,480 --> 01:17:59,680
Be strong.

796
01:18:01,960 --> 01:18:03,400
Be strong.

797
01:19:11,560 --> 01:19:13,120
There's nothing left.

798
01:19:13,200 --> 01:19:15,160
Just the panna cotta.

799
01:19:22,360 --> 01:19:24,360
We still have the panna cotta.

800
01:19:28,080 --> 01:19:30,360
The panna cotta is the message.

801
01:19:32,040 --> 01:19:34,760
The panna cotta is the message.

802
01:19:35,760 --> 01:19:37,600
The panna cotta is the message.

803
01:19:39,400 --> 01:19:42,440
The panna cotta is the message.

804
01:20:07,080 --> 01:20:08,400
There's nobody here.

805
01:20:10,480 --> 01:20:12,360
The platform's stopped.

806
01:20:14,120 --> 01:20:16,120
It must be the last level.

807
01:20:16,960 --> 01:20:19,960
Get ready. We'll go up now.

808
01:20:35,720 --> 01:20:37,280
The child...

809
01:20:37,360 --> 01:20:38,480
No.

810
01:20:44,160 --> 01:20:46,320
Don't do it. Don't do it.

811
01:20:58,520 --> 01:21:02,600
No, no, no, no! Fuck! Fuck!

812
01:21:17,200 --> 01:21:18,400
Throw out the panna cotta.

813
01:21:19,720 --> 01:21:22,120
- Throw out the panna cotta.
- No.

814
01:21:22,200 --> 01:21:24,080
Throw out the fucking panna cotta.

815
01:21:24,160 --> 01:21:26,120
No, no, no, no!

816
01:21:27,040 --> 01:21:28,400
Wait.

817
01:21:29,720 --> 01:21:30,760
Wait.

818
01:21:34,880 --> 01:21:36,400
It's not hot.

819
01:21:37,720 --> 01:21:39,000
Or cold.

820
01:21:58,320 --> 01:21:59,760
It's a girl.

821
01:22:11,560 --> 01:22:13,000
She's hungry.

822
01:22:21,360 --> 01:22:22,360
Give her a bit.

823
01:22:28,960 --> 01:22:29,960
No.

824
01:22:31,520 --> 01:22:33,320
The panna cotta is the message.

825
01:22:34,080 --> 01:22:35,680
The panna cotta is the message.

826
01:22:36,120 --> 01:22:37,560
The panna cotta is the message.

827
01:22:37,640 --> 01:22:39,880
The panna cotta is the message.

828
01:22:39,960 --> 01:22:41,800
The panna cotta is the message.

829
01:23:41,040 --> 01:23:44,160
<i>"A great man who is sin-ridden
can only be a great sinner,</i>

830
01:23:44,240 --> 01:23:47,200
<i>the wealthy man who is not generous...</i>

831
01:23:47,840 --> 01:23:51,280
<i>will be a miserly beggar.
The owner of wealth is not made happy</i>

832
01:23:51,360 --> 01:23:54,640
<i>by owning it, but by spending it,
and not by spending it capriciously,</i>

833
01:23:55,360 --> 01:23:57,040
<i>but by knowing how to spend it well."</i>

834
01:23:57,960 --> 01:23:59,200
What do you want?

835
01:24:00,160 --> 01:24:02,760
I like listening to you read.

836
01:24:03,640 --> 01:24:07,120
"Knowing how to spend it well."

837
01:24:07,200 --> 01:24:12,480
You were very daring to squander
the bounties of Level 6, my little snail.

838
01:24:12,560 --> 01:24:15,520
- I didn't squander it.
- What now?

839
01:24:15,600 --> 01:24:17,960
Will you eat the black guy?

840
01:24:20,120 --> 01:24:21,640
Why not the girl?

841
01:24:22,400 --> 01:24:25,760
The girl has a gift. Haven't you realized?

842
01:24:31,240 --> 01:24:33,200
Ramesses is the message.

843
01:24:33,280 --> 01:24:34,960
Ramesses II is the message.

844
01:24:35,880 --> 01:24:38,800
<i>Ramesses... Ramesses...</i>

845
01:24:39,560 --> 01:24:41,760
<i>Ramesses... Ramesses...</i>

846
01:24:42,720 --> 01:24:44,960
<i>Ramesses... Ramesses...</i>

847
01:24:45,560 --> 01:24:46,960
Hey! Wake up!

848
01:24:48,320 --> 01:24:50,120
The girl is the message.

849
01:24:50,200 --> 01:24:51,960
She is the message.

850
01:25:03,520 --> 01:25:05,040
She's the message.

851
01:25:11,800 --> 01:25:13,120
Baharat...

852
01:27:51,600 --> 01:27:55,320
"Together, we parted,
and together, we peregrinate.

853
01:27:56,000 --> 01:28:00,800
One luck and one fortune we shall share."

854
01:28:03,160 --> 01:28:05,480
Your journey is over, little snail.

855
01:28:13,160 --> 01:28:14,480
Not yet.

856
01:28:15,440 --> 01:28:18,880
- I've got to go back up with the girl.
<i>- </i>But you are not the message.

857
01:28:21,200 --> 01:28:22,720
But I'm her bearer.

858
01:28:22,800 --> 01:28:25,360
The message requires no bearer.

859
01:28:40,480 --> 01:28:42,040
Don't call me little snail again.

860
01:28:42,120 --> 01:28:44,520
Don't use my word again.

861
01:29:11,680 --> 01:29:13,320
She will succeed.

862
01:29:15,760 --> 01:29:17,200
She is the message.

863
01:29:17,680 --> 01:29:19,840
She is the message.
